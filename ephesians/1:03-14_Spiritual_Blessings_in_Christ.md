# Ephesians 1:3-14 Spiritual Blessings in Christ

ESV:

> Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in
> Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as he chose
> us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
> blameless before him. In love he predestined us for adoption to himself as
> sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, to the
> praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved. In
> him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses,
> according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished upon us, in all
> wisdom and insight making known to us the mystery of his will, according to
> his purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time,
> to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.
> 
> In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to
> the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will,
> so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his
> glory. In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your
> salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
> who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to
> the praise of his glory.

This entire passage is a single run-on sentence.  As such, I think it's a
useful exercise to editorialize each thought into an independent sentence.  In
places where the interpretation seems ambiguous to me, I've listed both.  My
guess is that the ambiguity is intended, rendering both correct.

The entire first paragraph is tied to the second paragraph by a colon.  The
implication is that the first paragraph is the What and the second paragraph is
the How.

- They (the writer, and their immediate audience), who were the first to hope
  in Christ, were chosen (perhaps for the task of initially spreading the
  gospel) to the praise of his glory.

There's another colon here.
